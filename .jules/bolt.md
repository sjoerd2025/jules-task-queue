## 2026-03-07 - Optimize rate-limiter.ts to prevent TOCTOU race condition
**Learning:** Performance optimizations should prioritize atomic database operations (e.g., Prisma `upsert`) where appropriate instead of the read-modify-write pattern (`findUnique` followed by `create` or `update`) to prevent unnecessary database round-trips and Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions.
**Action:** The database operations in `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` should use `upsert` followed by `update` to optimize performance and prevent race conditions.

## 2026-03-09 - Use atomic upsert to improve DB performance and prevent TOCTOU
**Learning:** Performance optimizations should prioritize atomic database operations (e.g., Prisma `upsert`) where appropriate instead of the read-modify-write pattern (`findUnique` followed by `create` or `update`) to prevent unnecessary database round-trips and Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions. This anti-pattern was found in `src/lib/jules.ts` and `src/app/api/auth/callback/github/route.ts`.
**Action:** Use a single atomic Prisma `upsert` when conditionally creating or updating records instead of relying on separate `findUnique` and `update`/`create` operations.
